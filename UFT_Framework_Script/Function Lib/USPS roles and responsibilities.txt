The information on each team varies but let me take a crack at it.
 
The team they will be working on is called Product Tracking and Reporting (PTR). PTR is the system of record for all delivery status information for mail 
and parcels with trackable services and barcodes. Product Tracking & Reporting System (PTR) provides the core corporate infrastructure for package visibility
 collecting and reporting location and delivery status for packages and mailpieces with Extra Services. PTR is the official data source for service performance reporting 
for parcels and Extra Services, including service measurement reporting mandated by Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA) for market dominant parcels 
and Extra Services. The Product Tracking and Reporting system accepts electronic manifests from mailers while also extracting scan event and payment data back to customers
 and various service providers. PTR offers 24x7 visibility of tracking events integrated across products with interfaces to customer call centers, retail terminals, the 
internet-driven USPS Tracking website, USPS Text Tracking, PostalOne! including the Electronic Verification System (eVS) and Scan Based Payment, Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW/PPR) 
and other field systems such as the Intelligent Mail Data Acquisition System (IMDAS), Mobile Delivery Device (MDD), Rural Workhour Tracker (RWHT), Retail Systems, Intelligent Mail 
Visibility (IM-VIS), and Surface Visibility (SV).
 
PTR has around 70 FTEs supporting the efforts. The team is mainly in Wilkes Barre but there are others supporting it from different USPS locations including their headquarters offices.
 
The team is currently transitioning from a waterfall environment to Agile. Most of USPS uses some version of Agile development currently.

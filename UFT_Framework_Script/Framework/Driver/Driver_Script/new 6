Garbage Collection in Java:
Process of reclaiming the runtime unused memory by destroying the unused objects.

Methods like free() in C, and delete() in C++ are used to perform Garbage Collection.

In Java, garbage collection happens automatically during the lifetime of a program.

At any point of time, the heap memory consists of two types of objects:

	Live - these objects are being used and referenced from somewhere else.
	Dead - these objects are no longer used or referenced from anywhere
	
The garbage collector finds these unused objects and deletes them to free up memory.
